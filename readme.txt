We have both malicious and benign files in our dataset. For proof of concept we have conducted our work with 1000 files having 500 malicious fiiles
and 500 benign files.The lates.csv file contains benign APKs which contributed in our dataset of benign APKs .You just need a script which can take input
of the corresponding file name and download Malicious APKs. We have downloaded Beign APKs from GOOGLE play store one by one and count is 500 each for benign and
Malicious.Runnning the conversion script on Benign and Malicous Apks we get binaries out of each file which then later on converted into images.

CNN model is then trained on the corresponding images to read the behaviour. Changing weights on each convolutional layer contributes in better understanding of the behaviour.
